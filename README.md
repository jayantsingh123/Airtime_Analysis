Airtime app is not any typical old app. Unlike most of the social apps, Airtime app is the app to be used if you like to talk to your friends, while watching your favorite TV shows on YouTube, Spotify etc.

## Dataset

* Timestamp(time of user entering a room),

* User(user id),

* Room(room id), and 

* Room_name (name of the party room the user has entered).
